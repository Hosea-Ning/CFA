### institutional investors: common characteristics

| | new | old |
|----|----|----|
| S | stakeholders | |
| L | liquidity needs | liquidity needs |
| L | liquidity and investment horizon | time horizon |
| E | external constraints | uniqueness |
| R | risk | risk |
| I | investment objectives | return |
| A | asset allocation | |

+ scale
  + may impact investment capabilities, access to strategies, liquidity, trading costs
  + have a high minimum investment size
  + outsource 外部资源
  + scale benefits
+ long-term investment horizon
  + pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and foundations have long investment horizons and low liquidity needs. Low liquidity needs allow these institutions to invest in a broad range of alternative asset classes
  + banks and insurance companies tend to be much more asset/liability focused
+ regulatory frameworks
+ governance frameworks
  + board of directors and investment committee
  + board comprise company representative directors, employee representative directors, and independent directors
+ principal-agent issues

### overview of investment policy

investment approaches:

+ Norway model:
  + sovereign wealth fund, 60%/40% equity/fixed-income, largely passive investments
  + pros: low cost, transparent, suitable for large scale, easy for board to understand
  + cons: limited value-added potential
+ endowment model
  + high alternative exposure, active management and outsourcing
  + pros: high value-added potential
  + cons: expensive and difficult to implement for most SWF because of large sizes; high costs
+ Canada model: pension plan
  + high alternative exposure, active management and internally managed assets
  + pros: high added value potential and development of internal capabilities
  + cons: potentially expensive and difficult to manage
+ Liability driven (banks and insurers)
  + focus on hedging liabilities and interest rate risk including via duration-matched, fixed-income exposure
  + pros: explicit recognition of liabilities as part of the investment process
  + cons: certain risks (e.g., longevity risk, inflation risk) may not change

### pension funds

| characteristics | DB plan | DC plan |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| benefit payments | defined by contract between employee and the pension plan | benefit are determined by the performance of investments selected by the participant |
| contribution | the employer is the primary contribution | the employee is the primary contributor |
| investment decision making | the pension fund determines how and what | the employee determines how and what |
| investment risk | employer bears the risk | employee bears the risk |
| mortality/ longevity risk | mortality risk is pooled. the individual does not bear any of the risk of outliving his/her retirement benefits | the employee bears the risk of not meeting his/ her objectives for this account. the employee bears longevity risk |

#### stakeholders

+ DB plan:  employer; plan beneficiaries (employees and retirees); the CIO and investment staff; the investment committee and/or board; and the government, unions, and shareholders in the case of corporate DB plans
+ DC plan: plan beneficiaries (e.g., the employer), the board, and the government.

#### liabilities and investment horizon

+ DB plan
  `vesting`: a term indicating that employees only become eligible to receive a pension after meeting certain criteria, typically a minimum number of years of service.

  Funded ratio = fair value of plan assets / PV of DB obligations

  | factor | impact of increase in factor |
  | ----   | ----------                   |
  | service/ tenure | increase liability  |
  | salary | increase liability  |
  | longevity | increase liability  |
  | additional contributions | increase liability  |
  | employee turnover | lower liability |  <!--higher employee turnover means fewer employees are likely to work the number of years of service required for vesting of benefits-->
  | expected investment | lower liability |
  | discount rate | lower liability |

+ DC plan
  + `participant-switching life-cycle options`: automatically switch DC plan members into a more conservative asset mix as their age increases. There may be several automatic de-risking switches at different age targets.
  + `participant/cohort option`: pools the DC member with a cohort that has similar target retirement date

### risk considerations of DB

| category | variable | explanation |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| plan status | plan funded status (surplus or deficit) | higher pension surplus implies greater risk tolerance |
| sponsor financial status and profitability | debt to total assets; current and expected profitability; size of plan compared to market capitalization of company | lower  debt ratios and higher current and expected profitability imply greater risk tolerance; large company size relative to pension plan size implies greater risk tolerance |
| sponsor and pension fund common risk exposures | correlation of sponsor operating results with pension asset returns | lower the correlation, greater the risk tolerance |
| plan features | provision for early retirement; provision for lump-sum distributions | such options tend to reduce the duration of plan liabilities, implying lower risk tolerance |
| workforce characteristics | age of workforce; active lives relative to retired lives | the younger the workforce and greater the proportion of active lives, the greater the duration of plan liabilities and the greater the risk tolerance |
