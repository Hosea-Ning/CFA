  + cons: expensive and difficult to implement for most SWF because of large sizes; high costs
+ Canada model: pension plan
  + high alternative exposure, active management and internally managed assets
  + pros: high added value potential and development of internal capabilities
  + cons: potentially expensive and difficult to manage
+ Liability driven (banks and insurers)
  + focus on hedging liabilities and interest rate risk including via duration-matched, fixed-income exposure
