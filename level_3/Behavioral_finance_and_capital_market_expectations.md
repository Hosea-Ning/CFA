    + emotional biases

### Traditional finance perspectives on individaul behavior

#### Utility theory and Bayes' Formula

rational investors make decisions consistent with utility theory.

`Utility theory`: maximize the present value of utility subject to a present value budget constraint.

+ completeness(完整性): A>B, A<B, A=B
+ transitivity: A=B, B=C -> A=C or A>B, B>C -> A>C
+ independence: if A > B, then A + xC > B + xC
+ continuity: if A > B > C, exists B = m * A + n * C

`Bayes' formula`: P(A|B) = [P(B|A)P(A)] / P(B)

`Certainty equivalent`: the maximum sum of money a person would pay to participate or the minimum sum of money a person would accept to not participate in an opportunity

### challenges to traditional finance and the REM

+ bounded rationality
+ people have difficulty prioritizing short-term spending goals over long-term (spending versus saving) goals and do not behave with perfect self-interest
+ absnece of perfect information
+ wealth utility functions
+ double inflection utility function: a utility function that changes based on levels of wealth

## Decision making

### Decision theory

expected value

### Bounded rationality

Bounded rationality assumes knowledge capacity limits and removes the assumptions of perfect information, fully rational decision making, and consistent utility maximization.

It describes the phenomenon whereby people gather some (but not all) available information.

### Prospect theory

The value function is defined by deviations from a reference point and is normally concave for gains (implying risk aversion), convex for losses (risk-seeking), and steeper for losses than for gains (loss aversion).

> steeper for losses than for gains

Prospect theory further relaxes the assumption of risk aversion and instead proposes loss aversion.

> Most people reject a gmable with even chances to win and lose, unless the possible win is at least twice the size of the possible losses.

> People are risk-seeking when there is a low probability of gains or a high probability of losses.

> deviations in decision making from the rational decisions of traditional finance result from overweighting low probability outcomes, underweighting moderate and high probability outcomes, and hvaing a value funciton for changes in wealth that is in general concave for gains convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains.

1. Editing process
   1. Codification: gain or loss respect to some reference point (gain/loss, probability; ...)
   2. Combination: simplified by combing the probabilities associated with identical gains or losses, i.e., (250, 0.2; 200, 0.25; 200, 0.15; 150, 0.4) -> (250, 0.2; 200, 0.4; 150, 0.4)
   3. Segregation: separate the riskless component from its risky component, i.e., (300, 0.8; 200, 0.2) -> (200, 1.0) + (100, 0.8; 0, 0.2)
   4. Cancellation: discarding common outcome probability pairs between choices
   5. Simplification
   6. Detection of dominance
2. Evaluation phase
   $$U = \sum_i w(p_i)v(x_i)$$

   where: w is a probabilitu-weighting function

### Traditional finance perspective

+ week-form efficient: current prices incorporate all past price and volume data. If markets are weakly efficient, managers cannot consistently generate excess returns using technical analysis.
+ semi-strong form: prices reflect all public information. If markets are semi-strong efficient, managers cannot consistently generate excess returns using technical or fundamental analysis.
+ strong-form efficiency: price reflects all privileged nonpublic information. No analysis based on inside and/or public information can consistently generate excess returns.

### market anomalies

+ fundamental anomalies
  > to semi-strong and strong-form efficiency
  + size effect: small sized firms tend to outperform large-sized firms (错误定价)
  + value effect: value stocks outperform growth stocks
+ technical anomalies
  > to all three forms of efficiency
  + moving average
  + trading range break
+ calendar anomalies
  > to all forms of EMH
  + January effect

### Consumption and savings

+ framing: 框架依赖
+ self-control
+ mental accounting

### Behavioral asset pricing

discount rate = risk-free rate + fundamental risk premium + **sentiment premium**

### Behavioral portfolio theory (BPT)

In BPT, investors construct their portfolios in **layers** and expectations of returns and attitudes toward risk vary between the layers.

+ importance assigned to each goal
+ allocation of funds within a layer
+ number of assets chosen for a lyer

### Adaptive markets hypothesis (AMH)

`AMH`: A hypothesis that applies principles of evolution - such as competition, adaption, and natural selection - to financial markets in an attempt to reconcile efficient markt theories with behavioral alternatives.

Success is defined as survival rather than as having maximized expected utility.

It assumes successful market participants apply heuristics until they no longer work and then adjust them accordingly.

### Points between traditional and behavioral

+ Traditional finance assumes that investors are rational: Investors are risk-averse,self-interested utility-maximizers who process available information in an unbiased way.
+ Traditional finance assumes that investors construct and hold optimal porfolios; optimal portolios are mean-variance efficient.
+ Traditioanl finance hypothesizes that markets are efficient: Market prices incorporate and reflect all available and relevant information.
+ Behavioral finance makes different (non-normative) assumptions about investor and market behavior.
+ Behavioral finance attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors; observed behaviors often differ from the idealized behaviors assumed under traditional finance.
+ Behavioral biases are observed to affect the financial decisions of individuals;
+ Bounded rationality is proposed as an alternative to assuming perfect information and perfect rationality on the part of individuals: Individuals are acknowledged to have informational, intellectual, and computational limitations and as a result may satisfice rather than optimize when making decisions.
+ **prospect theory** is proposed as an alternative to expected utility theory. Within propect theory, loss aversion is proposed as an alternative to risk aversion.
+ Markets are not always observed to be efficient; anomalous markets are observed.
+ Theories and models based on behavioral perspectives have been advanced to explain observed market behavior and portfolio construction.
+ One behavioral approach to asset pricing suggests that the discout rate used to value an asset should include a sentiment risk premium.
+ Behavioral portfolio theory suggests that portfolios are constructed in layers to satisfy investor goals rather than to be mean-variance efficient.
+ The behavioral life-cycle hypothesis suggests that people classify their assets into non-fungible mental accounts and develop spending (current consumption) and savings (future consumption) plans that, althought not optimal, achieve some balance between short-term gratification and long-term goals.
+ The adaptive markets hypothesis, based on some principles of evolutionary biology, suggests that the degree of market efficiency is related to environemmntal factors characterizing market available, and the adaptability of the market pariticipants.
+ By understanding investor behavior, it may be possible to construct investment solutions that will be closer to the rational solution of traditional finance and, because of adjustments reflecting behavioral insights, easier to accept and remain committed to.

`satisfice`: suboptimal, but adequate

## Begavioral Biases of individuals

`BFMI`: Behavioral Finance Micro, a focus on individual level behavior that examines the behavioral biases that distinguish individual investors from the rational decision makers of traditional finance.

`BFMA`: Behavioral Finance Macro, a focus on market level behavior that considers market anomalies that distinguish markets from the efficient markets of traditional finance.

`Cognitive errors`: behavioral biases resulting from faulty reasoning; cognitive errors stem from basic statistical, information processing, or memory errors.

2. individuals may exhibit characteristics of multiplt investor types
3. individuals will likely go through behavioral changes as they age
4. individuals are likely to require unique treatment even if they are classified as the same investor type because human behavior is so complex
5. individuals act irrationally at different times and without preidictability.

### client - adviser relations

1. understands the clients' goal
2. maintains a systematic approach
3. invest as the client expects
4. the relationship benefits both client and adviser
