steeper for losses than for gains

| Traditional Finance assumption | Behavioral finance assumption |
| -----------------------------  | ----------------------------- |
|  perfect information | capacity limitations on knowledge |
| utility maximization | satisfice                         |
| fully rational decision making | bounded rationality.    |
| risk aversion                  | loss averse             |

1. Editing process
   1. Codification: gain or loss respect to some reference point
   2. Combination: simplified by combing the probabilities associated with identical gains or losses
   3. Segregation: separate the riskless component from its risky component, i.e., (300, 0.8; 200, 0.2) -> (200, 1.0) + (100, 0.8; 0, 0.2)
   4. Cancellation: discarding common outcome probability pairs between choices
   5. Simplification
   6. Detection of dominance
2. Evaluation phase
   $$U = \sum_i w(p_i)v(x_i)$$

   where: w is a probabilitu-weighting function
