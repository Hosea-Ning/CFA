### inputs to capital sufficiency analysis

return assumption, current value of the portfolio, anticipated future contributions to the porfolio and cash flow

## return 计算

`TIA`: total intestable asset

1. open ended

    Return% = Cash flow needs / TIA + Asset (inflation compensation)

    Cash flow needs = cash in - cash out

    if expected return > 10%, 一般指asset base较小

## returns for taxable accounts


+ returns-based taxes: accrual taxes on interest and divide

$$FVIF_i = [1 + r(1 - t_i)]^n$$

+ returns-based taxes: deferred capital gains

$$FVIF_{cg} = (1 + r)^n - [(1 + r)^n - 1]t_{cg}$$

+ cost basis

$$FVIF_{cgb} = (1 + r)^n(1 - t_{cg}) + t_{cg}B$$

+ wealth-based taxes

$$FVIF_w = [(1 + r)(1 - t_w)]^n$$

+ blended taxing environments

$$r^* = r(1 - p_i t_i - p_d t_d - p_{cg} t_{cg})$$

+ effective capital gains tax rate

$$T^* = t_{cg}(1 - p_i - p_d - p_{cg}) / (1 - p_i t_i - p_d t_d - p_{cg} t_{cg})$$

$$FVIF_{Taxable} = (1 + r^*)^n(1 - T^*) + T^* - (1 - B)t_{cg}$$

## accrual taxation

$$FV = PV[1 + (1 - T)R]^N$$

`tax drag` is the reduction in return caused by the payment of taxes

tax drag% = $\frac{FV_{woTax} - FV_{wTax}}{FV_{woTax} - I_0}$

+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% increased
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% increased

## deferred capital gain tax

$$FVIF_{CGT} = (1 + R)^N - [(1+R)^N - 1]\times T_{CG} = (1+R)^N(1 - T_{CG}) + T_{CG}$$

tax drag% = tax rate

+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% unchanged
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% unchanged

## cost basis

$$FVIF_{CGT} = (1 + R)^N - [(1+R)^N - 1]\times T_{CG} - (1 - B)T_{CG} = (1+R)^N(1 - T_{CG}) + B\times T_{CG}$$

## wealth basis

$$FVIF = [(1 + R)(1 - T)]^N$$

+ tax drag% > tax rate
+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% and tax drag$ increased
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% **decreases**; tax drag$ increases;

## blend tax

$$r* = r(1 - p_i t_i - p_d t_d - p_{cg} t_{cg})$$

where $p_d$ is portion of dividends, $p_i$ portion of the interest income and $p_{cg}$ realized capital gain

## accrual equivalent tax rates

$$T_{AE} = 1 - \frac{R_{AE}}{r}$$

## accrual equivalent return

考虑所有税率后的等价收益

## types of investment accounts

+ taxable accounts: 完税资金，产生收益交税，取出来不用交税
+ tax-deferred accounts: 未完税资金，美国养老金，产生收益不交税，取出来交税
  $$FVIF_{TDA} = (1 + r)^n (1 - T_n)$$
+ tax-exempt accounts: 完税资金，产生收益不交税，取出来不用交税
  $$FVIF_{TEA} = (1 + r)^n$$

## the tax effects of trading behavior

+ tax allocation
+ time period management
+ tax loss saving/ harvesting: The practice of realizing a loss to offset a gain or income—and thereby reducing the current year’s tax obligation—is called tax loss harvesting
+ HIFO: highest in, first out

## estate planning in a global context

a `will` outlines the rights others will have over one's property after death

a `testator` is the person who authored the will and whose property is disposed of according to the will

`probate(遗嘱认证程序)` is the legal process to confirm the vailidity of the will so that executors, heirs, and other interested parties can rely on its authenticity

## probate

some instances, probate can be avoided:

+ joint ownership (共同所有人)
+ living trusts
+ retirement plans

## wealth transfer taxes

+ tax on income
+ tax on spending

+ comminty property rights: 共同财产继承权，范围只是共同财产
+ separate property rights: 独立产权

## core capital

`human capital`: an implied asset; the net present value of an investor's future expected labro income weighted by the probability of surviving to each future age.

## excess capital

an investor's capital over and above that which is necessary to fund their lifestyle and reserves

## relative aftwer-tax values

+ taxable

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n (1 - T_g)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

+ tax free

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n }{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

+ A给B钱A交税

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n (1 - T_g + T_g T_e)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

其中$T_g T_e$为税盾

+ A给B钱，B为慈善机构

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{charitableGift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{(1 + r_g)^n + T_{oi}[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n(1 - T_e)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

其中$T_{oi}[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n(1 - T_e)$为税盾

## estate planning strategy-generation skipping

$$FV_{noskipping} = PV[(1 + r)^{n1}(1 - t)][(1 + r)^{n2}(1 - t)]$$

$$FV_{skipping} = PV[(1 + r)^{N}(1 - T_e)]$$

where $N = n_1 + n_2$

+ spouse exemption
+ valuation discounts

## trust

+ revocable (归委托人，可撤销)/ irrevocable (所有权归受益人)
+ fixed (每年固定) / discretionary (根据实际情况调整)/ spendthrift (设定条件)

## life insurance

+ asset protection

## tax jurisdiction

+ source (资产属地) jurisdiction (territorial tax system)
+ residence (属人) jurisdiction

`Source tax system`: A jurisdiction that imposes tax on an individual’s income that is sourced in the jurisdiction.

`Residence tax system`: A jurisdiction that imposes a tax on an individual’s income based on residency whereby all income (domestic and foreign sourced) is subject to taxation.

### double taxation

+ residence-residence conflict, 看人的居住时间
+ source-source conflict
+ residence-source conflict: 先交source国, residence国提供税收优惠
  + credit method(complete): max(source, residence)
  + exemption method(complete): 只交source
  + deduction method(partial): T_source + (1 - T_source) * T_residence


<!-- $$J_{\theta} = -log\frac{exp(h^Tv_w')}{\sum_{w_i\in V}exp(h^Tv_w')} \\
             = -h^Tv_w' + log{\sum_{w_i\in V}exp(h^Tv_w')} \\
             =  \varepsilon (w) + log\sum_{w_i\in V}exp(-\varepsilon (w_i))$$

so we have

$$\nabla_{\theta} J_{\theta} = \nabla_{\theta} \varepsilon (w) + \nabla_{\theta} log\sum_{w_i\in V}exp(-\varepsilon (w_i)) \\
= \nabla_{\theta} \varepsilon (w) - \frac{1}{\sum_{w_j\in V} exp(-\varepsilon (w_j))}\sum_{w_\in V}exp(-\varepsilon (w_i)) \nabla_{\theta}\varepsilon (w_i) \\
= \nabla_{\theta} \varepsilon (w) - \sum_{w_i\in V} \frac{exp(-\varepsilon (w_i))}{\sum_{w_j\in V} exp(-\varepsilon (w_j))} \nabla_{\theta}\varepsilon (w_i) \\
= \nabla_{\theta} \varepsilon (w) - \sum_{w_i\in V} P(w_i) \nabla_{\theta}\varepsilon (w_i) \\
= \nabla_{\theta} \varepsilon (w) - \mathbb{E}_{w_i \sim P}[\nabla_{\theta}\varepsilon (w_i))$$ -->
