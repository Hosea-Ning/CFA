## return 计算

`TIA`: total intestable asset

1. open ended

Return% = Cash flow needs / TIA + Asset (inflation compensation)

Cash flow needs = cash in - cash out

if expected return > 10%, 一般指asset base较小

+ Assumption:
  + salary/expense 发生在期末
  + current portfolio 无成本变现，通通计入TIA
  + TIA收入为税后

2. close ended

## accrual taxation

$$FV = PV[1 + (1 - T)R]^N$$

`tax drag` is the reduction in return caused by the payment of taxes

tax drag% = $\frac{FV_{woTax} - FV_{wTax}}{FV_{woTax} - I_0}$

+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% increased
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% increased

## deferred capital gain tax

$$FVIF_{CGT} = (1 + R)^N - [(1+R)^N - 1]\times T_{CG} = (1+R)^N(1 - T_{CG}) + T_{CG}$$

tax drag% = tax rate

+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% unchanged
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% unchanged

## cost basis

$$FVIF_{CGT} = (1 + R)^N - [(1+R)^N - 1]\times T_{CG} - (1 - B)T_{CG} = (1+R)^N(1 - T_{CG}) + B\times T_{CG}$$

## wealth basis

$$FVIF = [(1 + R)(1 - T)]^N$$

+ tax drag% > tax rate
+ as the investment horizon increases, tax drag% and tax drag$ increased
+ as the investment return increases, tax drag% **decreases**; tax drag$ increases;

## blend tax

$$r* = r(1 - p_i t_i - p_d t_d - p_{cg} t_{cg})$$

where $p_d$ is portion of dividends, $p_i$ portion of the interest income and $p_{cg}$ realized capital gain

## accrual equivalent tax rates

$$T_{AE} = 1 - \frac{R_{AE}}{r}$$

## accrual equivalent return

考虑所有税率后的等价收益

## types of investment accounts

+ taxable accounts: 完税资金，产生收益交税，取出来不用交税
+ tax-deferred accounts: 未完税资金，美国养老金，产生收益不交税，取出来交税
  $$FVIF_{TDA} = (1 + r)^n (1 - T_n)$$
+ tax-exempt accounts: 完税资金，产生收益不交税，取出来不用交税
  $$FVIF_{TEA} = (1 + r)^n$$

## the tax effects of trading behavior

+ tax allocation
+ time period management
+ tax loss saving/ harvesting
+ HIFO: highest in, first out

## estate planning in a global context

a `will` outlines the rights others will have over one's property after death

a `testator` is the person who authored the will and whose property is disposed of according to the will

`probate(遗嘱认证程序)` is the legal process to confirm the vailidity of the will so that executors, heirs, and other interested parties can rely on its authenticity

## probate

some instances, probate can be avoided:

+ joint ownership (共同所有人)
+ living trusts
+ retirement plans

## wealth transfer taxes

## ownership rights

+ forced heirship rules: 强制继承权，父子...整个estate
+ comminty property rights: 共同财产继承权，范围只是共同财产
+ separate property rights: 独立产权

## core capital

core capital is the amount of assets (i.e., present value) necessary to meet all future liabilities. CC用无风险利率折现

## relative aftwer-tax values

+ taxable

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n (1 - T_g)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

+ tax free

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n }{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

+ A给B钱A交税

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{Gift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{[1 + r_g (1 - t_{ig})]^n (1 - T_g + T_g T_e)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

其中$T_g T_e$为税盾

+ A给B钱，B为慈善机构

$$RV_{taxableGift} = \frac{FV_{charitableGift}}{FV_{Bequest}} = \frac{(1 + r_g)^n + T_{oi}[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n(1 - T_e)}{[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n (1 - T_e)}$$

其中$T_{oi}[1 + r_e (1 - t_{ie})]^n(1 - T_e)$为税盾

## estate planning strategy-generation skipping

$$FV_{noskipping} = PV[(1 + r)^{n1}(1 - t)][(1 + r)^{n2}(1 - t)]$$

$$FV_{skipping} = PV[(1 + r)^{N}(1 - T_e)]$$

where $N = n_1 + n_2$

  + credit method(complete): max(source, residence)
  + exemption method(complete): 只交source
  + deduction method(partial): T_source + (1 - T_source) * T_residence
