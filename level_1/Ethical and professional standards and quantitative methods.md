## ethics and trusting the investment profession
> ethics: the study of moral principles or making good  choices. Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behavior.
> stakeholders: individuals or groups of individuals who may be affected either directly or indirectly by a decision and thus have an interest, or stake, in the decision.
> code of ethics: an established guide that communicates an organization's values and overall expectations regarding member behavior. A code of ethics serves as a general guide for how community members should act.
> standards of conduct: behaviors required by a group; established **benchmarks** that clarify or enhance a group's code of ethics.
> a profession refers to a group of people with specialized skills and knowledge who serve others and agree to behave in accordance with a code of ethics.

### challenges to ethical behavior
+ people tend to believe that they are ethical people and that their ethical standards are higher than average.
+ decision makers often fail to recognize and/or significantly underestimate the effect of situational influences, such as what other people around them are doing.

> situational influences: external factors, such as environmental or cultural elements, that shape our behavior.

### the importance of ethical conduct in the investment industry

### Ethical VS. Legal standards
Not all unethical actions are illegal, and not all illegal actions unethical.
In general, ethical decisions require more judgment and consideration of the impact of behavior on many stakeholders compared to legal decisions.

### ethical decision-making frameworks
the following ethical decision-making framework is presented in the Level 1 CFA curriculum:

+ Identify: relevant facts, stakeholders and duties owed, ethical principles, conflicts of interest.
+ Consider: situational influences, additional guidance, alternative actions
+ Decide and act
+ Reflect: Was the outcome as anticipated? Why or why not?
