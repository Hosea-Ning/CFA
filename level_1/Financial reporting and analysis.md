# Financial reporting and analysis
Business activities can be classified into three groups: `operating activities`, `investing activities` and `financing activities`
companies classify transaction into common accounts that are components of the five financial statement elements: `assets`, `liabilities`, `equity`, `revenue`, and `expense`.

## Basic formula
<span style="color: red">$$Assets = Liabilities + Owners'\ equity$$</span>

$$Assets = Liabilities + Contributed\ capital + Ending\ retained\ earnings$$

> contributed capital: 投入资本

$$Owners'\ equity = Contributed\ capital + Retained\ earnings$$

$$Revenue - Expenses = Net\ income$$

$$Ending\ retained\ earings = Beginning\ retained\ earnings + Net\ income - Dividends$$

+ assets: economic resources of a company
    * non-current assets:
        - intangible assets including goodwill
        - property, plant, and equipment
        - investment property
        - investments in joint ventures and associates
    * current assets:
        - inventories
        - trade and other receivables
        - cash and cash equivalents
+ liabilities: creditors' claims on the resources
+ owners' equity: residual claim on those resources;
+ expense: outflows of economic resources or increases in liabilities

+ Balance sheet
+ Income statement
+ statement of cash flow
+ statement of owners' equity

## Accrual accounting(权责发生制)
+ unearned revenue(or deferred revenue) 预收账款，已收款，权利义务并为交割
+ unbilled revenue(accrued revenue): arises when a company earns revenue prior to receiving cash but has not yet recognized the revenue at the end of an accounting period. 应计收入，权利义务已交割，但收入未到账
+ prepaid expense
+ accrued expense: arise when a company incures expenses that have not yet been paid as of the end of an accounting period

### valuation adjustments

## accounting systems
### flow of information in an accounting system
+ general ledger(总分类账): collection of all business transactions sorted by account in an accounting system
+ general journal(普通日记账): collection of all business activities sorted by date

`Journal entries and adjusting entries` -> `General ledger and T-accounts` -> `Trial balance and adjusted trial balance` -> `Financial statements`

# Financial reporting standards
+ International Accounting Standards Board (IASB): the independent standard-setting body of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) Foundation
+ US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): established US GAAP (generally accepted accounting practices)
## objective of financial reporting
To provide financial information in making decisions.

### The securities and exchange commission (SEC)
The following are some of the more common information sources used by analysts
+ securities offerings registration statement
+ Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F
+ Annual Report
+ Proxy statement/Form DEF-14A
+ Forms 10-Q and 6-K

### miscellaneous
+ A core objective of the IOSCO is to ensure that the markets are fair, efficient, and transparent. The other core objectives are to reduce, not eliminate, systematic risk and to protect investors, not all users of financial statements.
+ Rules-based, principles-based, and objectives-oriented approaches are recognized approaches to standard-setting.
+ other summary see page 137

## revenue recognition
> income: income is increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.

### general principles
**IFRS** specifies the revenue from the sale of goods is to be recognized when the following conditions are satisfied:
+ the entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
+ the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
+ the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
+ it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
+ the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

**US GAAP** specify that revenue should be recognized when it is "realized or realizable and earned" with following lists:
+ there is evidence of an arrangement between buyer and seller.
+ the product has been delivered, or the service has been rendered.
+ the price is determined, or determinable.
+ the seller is reasonably sure of collecting money.

### revenue recognition in special cases
before transaction|after transaction
-----------|------------
the percentage-of-completion method is used|the installment method and cost recovery method are appropriate

> down payment: 首付

+ install method: the portion of the total profit of the sale that is recognized in each period is determined by the percentage of the total sales price for which the seller has received cash.
+ cost recovery method: the seller does not report any profit until the cash amounts paid by the buyer-including principal and interest on any financing from the seller-are greater than all the seller's costs for merchandise sold.

### inventory costing methods
Method| Description| COGS when prices are rising| Ending Inventory when prices are rising
----|--------|---------|----------
FIFO|first in, first out|Lowest|Highest
LIFO|last in, first out|Highest|Lowest
Weighted average cost|---|Middle|Middle
> LIFO is **prohibited** under IFRS

### depreciation expense recognition
* straight-line method: (cost - residual)/useful life
* double declining method: 2*(cost - accumulated depreciation)/useful life

### Non-recurring item
+ discounted operations: is one that management has decided to dispose of, but either has not yet done so, or has disposed of in the current year after the operation had generated income or losses.
+ continuing operations

### Basic EPS

$$Basic\ EPS = \frac{Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ share\ outstanding}$$

> the weighted average number of shares outstanding is a time weighting of common shares outstanding.
> weighted average numbers = [T1 * out1 +(T2-T1) * (out2+out1) + (T3-T2) * (out3+out2+out1)+...+(T_N-T_{N-1})*(outN+...+out1)]/(TN)

#### diluted EPS when a company has convertible preferred stock outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + New\ common\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ conversion)}$$

#### diluted EPS when a company has convertible debt outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income + After-tax\ interest\ on\ convertible\ debt - Preferred\ dividends)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + Additional\ common\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ conversion)}$$

#### diluted EPS when a company has option outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + (New\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ option\ exercise - Shares\ that\ could\ have\ been\ purchased\ with\ cash\ received\ upon\ exercise) \times (Proportion\ of\ year\ during\ which\ the\ financial\ instruments\ were\ outstanding)}$$

### Income statement ratios
$$Net\ profit\ margin = \frac{Net\ income}{Revenue}$$
$$Gross\ profit\ margin = \frac{Gross\ profit}{Revenue}$$

### miscellaneous
+ expenses may be categorized by either nature of function:
    * expense by function: COGS;
    * expense by nature: tax expense/ interest expense
+ net revenue is revenue for goods sold during the period less any returns and allowances
+ for long term:
    * percentage-of-complete method: both for US GAAP & IFRS when outcome can be measured reliably
    * completed contract method is used under US GAAP when outcome cannot be measured reliably
    * cost recovery method is used under IFRS when outcome cannot be measure reliably

# understanding balance sheets

## current and non-current classification
+ current assets include cash and other assets that will likely be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is greater.
    * cash and cash equivalents
    * marketable securities
    * accounts receivable
    * inventories
        following techniques can be used for measurement of the cost:
        - standard cost
        - retail method: sales value is reduced by the gross margin to calculate cost
    * other current assets
+ current liabilities are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or operating cycle.
    * accounts payable
    * notes payable and current portion of long-term debt
    * deferred income or unearned earning
+ non-current assets will not be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle.
    * property, plant and equipment (PP&E)
        - recoverable amount: the higher of an asset's fair value less cost, and its value in use
        - fair value less cost
        - value in use: the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets
    * investment property
    * intangible assets
    * good will
    * financial assets
        - derivatives
        - held-to-maturity
        - held for trading
        - available-for-sale
+ non-current liabilities
    * long-term financial liabilities
    * deferred tax liabilities
+ current assets minus current liabilities equals **working capital**
+ equity
    * contributed capital
    * preferred shares
    * treasury shares
    * retained earning (留存收益)
    * accumulated other comprehensive income
    * noncontrolling interest (or minority interest)

## common size analysis
+ vertical common-size analysis
+ cross sectional common-size analysis

## balance sheet ratio
### liquidity ratios
ratio| calculation | indicates
----|------------|---------
current ratio| current asset / current liabilities| ability to meet current liabilities
quick ratio|(cash+marketable securities + receivables) / current liabilities| ability to meet current liabilities more
cash ratios|(cash+marketable securities) / current liabilities|most

### solvency ratios
ratio| calculation | indicates
----|------------|---------
long-term debt-to-equity| long-term debt / total equity|financial risk and financial leverage
debt-to-equity|total debt / total equity|ditto
total debt| total debt / total assets|ditto
financial leverage|total assets / total equity| ditto

### miscellaneous
+ accrued liabilities: 应计费用
+ impairment write-downs: reduction in equity

# understand cash flow statements
+ cash flow from operation activities (CFO)
+ cash flow from investing activities (CFI)
+ cash flow from financing activities (CFF)
**noncash investing and financing activities** are not reported in the cash flow statement since they do not result in inflows or outflows of cash.
+ Direct method: shows the specific cash inflows and outflows that result in reported cash flow from operating activities.
    * advantage: it presents the firm's operating cash receipts and payments while the indirect method only presents the net result of these receipts and payments.
+ Indirect method: shows how cash flow from operations can be obtained from reported net income as the result of a series of adjustments.
    * advantage: it focuses on the differences in net income and operating cash flow.

## linkage and preparation
### linkage
+ operating cash flow + financing cash flow + investing cash flow = change in cash balance
+ change in cash balance + beginning cash balance = ending cash balance
