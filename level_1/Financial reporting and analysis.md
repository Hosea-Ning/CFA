# Financial reporting and analysis
Business activities can be classified into three groups: `operating activities`, `investing activities` and `financing activities`
companies classify transaction into common accounts that are components of the five financial statement elements: `assets`, `liabilities`, `equity`, `revenue`, and `expense`.

## Basic formula
<span style="color: red">$$Assets = Liabilities + Owners'\ equity$$</span>

$$Assets = Liabilities + Contributed\ capital + Ending\ retained\ earnings$$

> contributed capital: 投入资本

$$Owners'\ equity = Contributed\ capital + Retained\ earnings$$

$$Revenue - Expenses = Net\ income$$

$$Ending\ retained\ earings = Beginning\ retained\ earnings + Net\ income - Dividends$$

+ assets: economic resources of a company
    * non-current assets:
        - intangible assets including goodwill
        - property, plant, and equipment
        - investment property
        - investments in joint ventures and associates
    * current assets:
        - inventories
        - trade and other receivables
        - cash and cash equivalents
+ liabilities: creditors' claims on the resources
+ owners' equity: residual claim on those resources;
+ expense: outflows of economic resources or increases in liabilities

## Accrual accounting(权责发生制)
+ unearned revenue(or deferred revenue) 预收账款，已收款，权利义务并为交割
+ unbilled revenue(accrued revenue): arises when a company earns revenue prior to receiving cash but has not yet recognized the revenue at the end of an accounting period. 应计收入，权利义务已交割，但收入未到账
+ prepaid expense
+ accrued expense: arise when a company incures expenses that have not yet been paid as of the end of an accounting period

### valuation adjustments

## accounting systems
### flow of information in an accounting system
+ general ledger(总分类账): collection of all business transactions sorted by account in an accounting system
+ general journal(普通日记账): collection of all business activities sorted by date

`Journal entries and adjusting entries` -> `General ledger and T-accounts` -> `Trial balance and adjusted trial balance` -> `Financial statements`

# Financial reporting standards
+ International Accounting Standards Board (IASB): the independent standard-setting body of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) Foundation
+ US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): established US GAAP (generally accepted accounting practices)
## objective of financial reporting
To provide financial information in making decisions.

### The securities and exchange commission (SEC)
The following are some of the more common information sources used by analysts
+ securities offerings registration statement
+ Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F
+ Annual Report
+ Proxy statement/Form DEF-14A
+ Forms 10-Q and 6-K

### miscellaneous
+ A core objective of the IOSCO is to ensure that the markets are fair, efficient, and transparent. The other core objectives are to reduce, not eliminate, systematic risk and to protect investors, not all users of financial statements.
+ Rules-based, principles-based, and objectives-oriented approaches are recognized approaches to standard-setting.
+ other summary see page 137

## revenue recognition
> income: income is increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.

### general principles
**IFRS** specifies the revenue from the sale of goods is to be recognized when the following conditions are satisfied:
+ the entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
+ the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
+ the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
+ it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
+ the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

**US GAAP** specify that revenue should be recognized when it is "realized or realizable and earned" with following lists:
+ there is evidence of an arrangement between buyer and seller.
+ the product has been delivered, or the service has been rendered.
+ the price is determined, or determinable.
+ the seller is reasonably sure of collecting money.

### revenue recognition in special cases
before transaction|after transaction
-----------|------------
the percentage-of-completion method is used|the installment method and cost recovery method are appropriate

> down payment: 首付

+ install method: the portion of the total profit of the sale that is recognized in each period is determined by the percentage of the total sales price for which the seller has received cash.
+ cost recovery method: the seller does not report any profit until the cash amounts paid by the buyer-including principal and interest on any financing from the seller-are greater than all the seller's costs for merchandise sold.

### inventory costing methods
Method| Description| COGS when prices are rising| Ending Inventory when prices are rising
----|--------|---------|----------
FIFO|first in, first out|Lowest|Highest
LIFO|last in, first out|Highest|Lowest
Weighted average cost|---|Middle|Middle

### Basic EPS

$$Basic\ EPS = \frac{Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ share\ outstanding}$$

> the weighted average number of shares outstanding is a time weighting of common shares outstanding.
> weighted average numbers = [T1 * out1 +(T2-T1) * (out2+out1) + (T3-T2) * (out3+out2+out1)+...+(T_N-T_{N-1})*(outN+...+out1)]/(TN)

#### diluted EPS when a company has convertible preferred stock outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + New\ common\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ conversion)}$$

#### diluted EPS when a company has convertible debt outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income + After-tax\ interest\ on\ convertible\ debt - Preferred\ dividends)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + Additional\ common\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ conversion)}$$

#### diluted EPS when a company has convertible debt outstanding
$$Diluted\ EPS = \frac{(Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends)}{(Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + (New\ shares\ that\ would\ have\ been\ issued\ at\ option\ exercise - Shares\ that\ could\ have\ been\ purchased\ with\ cash\ received\ upon\ exercise) \times (Proportion\ of\ year\ during\ which\ the\ financial\ instruments\ were\ outstanding)}$$

### Income statement ratios
$$Net\ profit\ margin = \frac{Net\ income}{Revenue}$$
$$Gross\ profit\ margin = \frac{Gross\ profit}{Revenue}$$
