# economics

## demand analysis: the customer
> demand function: a relationship that expresses the quantity demanded of a good or service as function of own-price and possibly other variables.

$$Q_x^d = f(P_x, I, P_y)$$
where
$Q_x^d$ = the quantity demanded of some good X
$P_x$ = price per unit of good X
I = consumers' income
$P_y$ = price of another good, Y

### own-price elasticity of demand
> Elasticity: the percentage change in one variable for a percentage change in another variable; a general measure of how sensitive one variable is to a change in the value of another variable
> Own-price elasticity of demand: the percentage change in quantity demanded for a percentage in good's own price, holding all other things constant

$$E_{p_x}^d = \frac{\% \Delta Q_x^d}{\% \Delta P_x} = (\frac{\Delta Q_x^d}{\Delta P_x})(\frac{P_x}{Q_x^d})$$

+ inelastic: the magnitude of elasticity is less than one
+ elastic: the magnitude of elasticity is greater than one
+ unit elastic: the magnitude is -1.0
+ perfectly elastic: the quantity demanded of a given good is infinitely sensitive to a change of price
+ perfectly inelastic: the quantity is completely insensitive to a change in the value of a specified variable (e.g., price)

Income elasticity of demand is defined as follows
$$E_{I}^d = \frac{\% \Delta Q_x^d}{\% \Delta I}$$

### cross-price elasticity of demand
> the percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in the price of another good; the responsiveness of the demand for Product A that is associated with change in price of Product B.

$$E_{p_y}^d = \frac{\% \Delta Q_x^d}{\% \Delta P_y}$$

+ substitutes: said of two goods such that if the price of one increases the demand for the other tends to increase, holding all other thins equal (e.q., butter and margarine)
+ complements: goods that tend to be used together; technically, two goods whose cross-price elasticity of demand is negative

+ the substitution effect: a decrease in price tends to cause consumers to buy more of this good in place of other goods
+ the income effect: the increase in real income resulting from the decline in this good's price causes people to buy even more of this goods when its price falls

+ normal goods: goods that are consumed in greater quantities as income increase
+ inferior goods: goods whose consumption decreases as income increases

+ Giffen good is an inferior good for which the negative income effect outweighs the positive substitution effect when price falls. At lower prices, a smaller quantity would be demanded as a result of the dominance of the income effect over the substitution effect.
+ Veblen good is one for which a higher price makes the good more desirable.

## supply analysis: the firm
+ law of diminishing marginal returns: the observation that a variable factor's marginal product must eventually fall as more of it is added to a fixed amount of the other factors

The factors of production:
+ land
+ labor
+ capital
+ materials

### breakeven and shutdown analysis
+ marginal revenue: the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity sold; simply, the additional revenue from selling one more unit.
    $$MR = \Delta TR / \Delta Q$$
+ marginal cost: the cost of producing an additional unit of a good.
    $$MC = \Delta TC / \Delta Q$$

 The relationship between MR and price elasticity can be expressed as
 $$MR = P [1 - (1 / \varepsilon_p)]$$
+ average total cost, average variable cost, average fixed cost, and marginal cost
    ![AVC](/Users/shouzeluo/Desktop/AVC.png)
+ revenue under conditions of perfect and imperfect competition
    ![competition](/Users/shouzeluo/Desktop/competition.png)
+ normal profit: level of accounting profit needed to just cover the implicit opportunity costs ignored in accounting costs; 是指企业主如果把资源用于其它相同风险的事业所可能得到的收入，它属于机会成本性质
+ quasi-fixed cost: a cost that stays the same over a range of production but can change to another constant level when production moves outside of that range.

> SMC: short-run marginal cost

#### shutdown and breakeven under perfect competition
+ if AR >= ATC, the firm should stay int he market in both the short and long run.
+ if AR >= ATC but AR < AVC, the firm should stay in the market in the short run but will exit the market in the long run.
+ if AR < AVC, the firm should shut down in  the short run and exit the market in the long run.
+ AR = MR = Price

#### shutdown and breakeven under perfect competition
+ TR = TC: break even
+ TC > TR > TVC: firm should continue to operate in the short run but shut down in the long run.
+ TR < TVC: firm should shut down in the short run and the long run.

## analysis of market structures
+ perfect competition: a market structure in which the individual firm has virtually no impact on market price, because it is assumed to be a very small seller among a very large number of firms selling essentially identical products.
+ monopolistic competition (垄断竞争): highly competition form of imperfect competition; the competitive characteristic is a notably large number of firms, while the monopoly aspect is the result of product differentiation.
+ oligopoly
+ monopoly

### factors that determine market structure
+ the number and relative size of firms supplying the product;
+ the degree of product differentiation;
+ the power of the seller over pricing decisions;
+ the relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit;
+ the degree of non-price competition

Structure | Perfect competition | monopolistic competition | oligopoly | monopoly
----------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------|---------
number of sellers | many | many | few | single
barriers to entry | very low | low | high | very high
nature of substitute products | very good substitute | good but differentiated | very good substitute or differentiated | no good substitute
nature of competition | price only | price, marketing, features | price, marketing, features | advertising
pricing power | None | some | some to significant | significant

## perfect competition
perfectly elastic
In a perfectly competitive market, MR = MC = ATC =  P, and will not earn economic profits for any significant period.

#### consumer surplus: value minus expenditure
> the consumer surplus is the difference between the value that a consumer places on units purchased and the amount of money that was required to pay for them

## monopolistic competition

+ for Short-run, P is chosen when MR = MC, the profit is (P - ATC)*Q
+ for Long-run, P = ATC where the demand curve is tangent to the ATC curve, the profit is 0.

### oligopoly

kinked demand curve
![kinked](https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/books/9781942471899/epubcfi/6/18%5B%3Bvnd.vst.idref%3DCFA0132-R04-15%5D!/4/4%5Bchapter-15%5D/16%5BCFA0132-R-s05%5D/10%5BCFA0132-R-s05-01%5D/18%5BCFA0132-R-EXH13B%5D/4/2%400:212)

+ game theory: the set of tools decision makers use to incorporate responses by rival decision makers into their strategies.
+ Nash equilibrium: When two or more participants in a non-coop-erative game have no incentive to deviate from their respective equilibrium strategies given their opponent's strategies. The firms do not collude in an effort to maximize joint profits

+ dominant firm model: the price $P_L$ is taken according to the quantity, $Q_L$ of the dominant firm whose cost is relatively low and the quantity meets when its marginal cost $MC_L$ equals marginal revenue $MR_L$

### monopoly
To maximize profit, monopolies will expand output until MR = MC. Therefore, long-run positive economic profits can exists.
Monopolies are price searchers and have imperfect information regarding market demand.

+ price discrimination
    * first-degree: a monopolist is able to charge each customer the highest price the customer is willing to pay.
    * second-degree: the monopolist offers a menu of quantity-based pricing options designed to induce customers to self-select based on how highly they value the product.
    * third-degree: happens when customers are segregated by demographic or other traits.

## identification of market structure
+ concentration ratio, which is the sum of the market shares of the largest N firms
+ Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) the market share of the top N companies are first squared and then added. $\sum_{i=1}^N \%share_i$. The HHI does not take the possibility of entry into account, nor does it consider the elasticity of demand.

## miscellaneous
+ collusion is less likely in a market when companies have similar market shares
+ over time, the market share of the dominant company in an oligopolistic market will most likely decrease
+ a government entity that regulates an authorized monopoly will most likely base regulated prices on long run average cost

# aggregate output, prices and economic growth
+ aggregate output of an economy is the value of all the goods and services produced in a specified period of time.
+ aggregate income is the value of all the payments earned by the suppliers of factors used in the production of goods and service.
+ rent is payment for the use of property
+ interest is payment for lending funds
+ profit is the return that owners of a company receive for the use of their capital and the assumption of financial risk when making their investments.

> Gross domestic product (GDP): is the total market value of the goods and services produced in a country within a certain time period.
> GDP: is also the aggregate income earned by all households, all companies, and the government within the economy in a given period of time.

+ Three broad criteria are used for measuring GDP consistently over time and across countries
    * All goods and services included in the calculation of GDP must be produced during the measurement period. e.g. houses, cars produced in previous periods.
    * The only goods and services included in the calculation of GDP are those whose value can be determined by being sold in the market. e.g. labor used in activities that are not sold on the market
    * only the market value of final goods and services is included in GDP. e.g. intermediate goods are excluded.

### sum-of-final-output method v.s. sum-of-value-added method

### nominal and real GDP
Nominal $GDP_t = P_t \times Q_t$
where
$P_t$ = Prices in year t

Real $GDP_t = P_B \times Q_t$
where
$P_B$ = Prices in the base year

The implicit price deflator for GDP, or simply the GDP deflato, is defined as

GDP deflator =Value of current year output at current year prices/ value of current year output at base year prices * 100 = Nominal GDP / Real GDP * 100

### the components of GDP
using the expenditure approach, the major components of real GDP are consumption, investment, government spending and net exports.
$$GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$$
where:
C = consumer spending on final goods and services
I = gross privet domestic investment, which includes business investment in capital goods and changes in inventory
G = government spending on final goods and services
X = exports
M = imports

under the income approach, we have the following equation for GDP:
GDP = national income + capital consumption allowance (ACC) + statistical discrepancy

A capital consumption allowance (CCA) measures the depreciation of physical capital from the  production of goods and services over a period. The statistical discrepancy is an adjustment for the difference between GDP measured under income approach and the expenditure approach because the use different data.

national income is the income received by all factors of production used in the generation of final output.
National income = Compensation of employees
+ corporate and government enterprise profits before taxes
+ interest income
+ unincorporated (不具法人资格的) business net income
+ rent
+ indirect business taxes less subsidies

personal income = national income
+ transfer payments
- indirect business taxes
- corporate income taxes
- undistributed corporate profits

personal disposable income (PDI) is equal to personal income less personal taxes

personal disposable income = personal income - personal taxes

### balancing aggregate income and expenditure: the IS curve

$$Y + F - S_B - R = C + S_H$$
where
Y is GDP;
F is transfer payment (经常性转移收入，政府转移和其他部门转移，如政府补助);
$S_B$ is business saving, namely retained earnings and depreciation;
R is indirect taxes;
C is consumption of goods and services;
$S_H$ is household saving

we get this equation rearranged
$$Y = C + S + T$$
where $T = R - F$ denotes net taxes and $S = (S_B + S_H)$ denote total private sector saving

So we have
$$C + S + T = C + I +G + (X - M)$$

$$S = I + (G - T) + (X - M)$$
This equation shows that domestic private saving is used or absorbed in one or three ways: investment (I), financing government deficits (G - T) and building up financial claims against overseas economies (X - M),net export could include lending to foreigners and purchases of assets from foreigners

+ consumption is a function of disposable income
    + marginal propensity to consume (MPC): the proportion of an additional unit of disposable income that is consumed or spent; the change in consumption for a small change in income.
    + marginal propensity to save (MPS): the proportion of an additional unit of disposable income that is saved (not spent).
+ investment is a function of expected profitability and the cost of financing.
    * real interest rate: nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation
+ government purchases may be viewed as independent of economic activity to a degree, but tax revenue to the government and therefore the fiscal balance, is clearly a function of economic output.
+ net exports are a function of domestic disposable incomes

The IS curve (income-saving) illustrates the negative relationship between real interest rates and real income for equilibrium in the **goods market**; the IS curve represents combinations of income and the real interest rate at which planned expenditure equals income.

### equilibrium in the money market: the LM curve
$$MV = PV$$

In this equation, V is velocity of money, M is the nominal money supply, P is the price level and Y is the real income/expenditure

the LM curve illustrates the positive relationship between real interest rates and income consistent with equilibrium in the **money market**; LM curve represented combination of income and the interest rate at which the demand for real money balance equals the supply

## aggregate supply (AS) curve
+ very short-run aggregate supply (VSRAS) curve: adjust output without changing price by adjusting labor hours and intensity of use of plant and equipment in response to changes in demand.
+ short-run aggregate supply (VSRAS) curve: slope upward
+ long-run aggregate supply (VSRAS) curve: perfectly inelastic. In the long run, wages and other input prices change proportionally to the price level, so the price level has no long-run effect on aggregate supply.

## shift in aggregated demand curve
$$GPD = C + I + G + net\ X$$
make it shift to the right
+ increase in customers' wealth: C increases
+ business expectations: optimism make I increases
+ consumer expectations of future income: C increases
+ high capacity utilization: I increases
+ expansionary monetary policy: C and I increases
+ expansionary fiscal policy: C increases for tax cut and G increase for spending increases
+ exchange rates: a decrease in the relative value of a country's currency will increase exports and decrease imports. Both of these effects tend to increase domestic aggregate demand (net X increases)
+ global economic growth: net X increases

## shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve
make the SRAS curve shift to the right
+ Increase of labor productivity
+ Decrease of input prices: the wages often have the greatest impact on SRAS
+ Increase of expectation of future output prices
+ Decrease of taxes and increase of government subsidies
+ Appreciation of exchange rates: appreciation of a country's currency in the foreign exchange market will decrease the cost of imports. To the extent that productive inputs are purchased from foreign countries, the resulting decrease in production costs will causes firms to increase output, increasing SRAS.

## shift in the long-run aggregate supply curve
shift to the right
+ increase in the supply and quality of labor
+ increase in the supply of natural resources
+ increase in the stock of physical capital
+ technology

### economic phenomenon
+ recessionary gap: AD decreases -> SRAS increases. Because of decrease of AD, unemployment rate rises
+ inflation gap: AD increases -> SRAS decreases
+ stagflation: SRAS decreases, high unemployment

Type of change | Real GDP | unemployment | Price level
---------------|----------|--------------|-----------
increase in AD | increase | decrease     | increase
decrease in AD | decrease | increase     | decrease
increase in AS | increase | decrease     | decrease
decrease in AS | decrease | increase     | increase

## economic growth
### sustainability of economic growth
the sustainable rate of growth in an economy is determined by the growth rate of the **labor supply** plus the growth rate of **labor productivity**.
+ growth in potential GDP = growth in technology + W_L(growth in labor) + W_C(growth in capital)
    where W_L and W_C are the relative shares of capital and labor in national income.
+ Labor productivity = Real GDP/ aggregate hours
    $$Y/L = A F(1, K/L)$$
+ potential GDP = Aggregate hours worked * labor productivity
+ potential growth rate = long-term growth rate of labor force + long-term labor productivity growth rate

Diminishing marginal productivity implies that
+ increasing the supply of some inputs relative to other inputs will lead to diminishing returns and cannot be the basis for sustainable growth. In particular, long-term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on capital deepening, that is, increasing the stock of capital relative to labor.
+ given the relative scarcity and hence high productivity of capital in developing countries, the growth rate of developing countries should exceed that of developed countries.

### sources of economic growth
+ labor supply
    the labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The capital stock in a country increase with investment. Correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high.
    total hours worked = labor force * average hours worked per worker
+ human capital: essentially the quality of the labor force
+ physical capital
+ technology
    total factor productivity is a scale factor that reflects the portion of output growth that is not accounted for by changes in the capital and labor inputs. TFP is mainly a reflection of technological change
    total factor productivity (TFP) = growth in potential GDP - [ W_L(growth in labor) + W_C(growth in capital) ]
+ natural resources
    * renewable resources
    * non-renewable resources

# understanding business cycles

+ inventory-sales ratio

### consumer behavior
+ durable goods: such as autos, furniture, a weakness in durables spending may be an early indication of general economic weakness, and an increase in such spending may signal a more general cyclical recovery.
+ non-durable goods: such as food, medicine
+ services: such as entertainment

### housing sector behavior
+ mortgage rates: low interest rates tend to increase home buying and construction while high interest rates tend to reduce home buying and construction.
+ housing costs relative to income:  housing activity can decrease even when incomes are rising late in a cycle if home prices are rising faster than incomes, leading to decreases in purchase and construction activity in the housing sector.
+ speculative activity
+ demographic factors

### external trade sector behavior
+ *imports* generally respond to *domestic GDP* growth rate while *export* generally respond to the *global GDP* growth rates

## theories of the business cycle
+ Neoclassical Schools
    * believes shifts in both AD and AS are primarily driven by changes in technology over time. They also believe that the economy has a strong tendency toward full-employment equilibrium, because of the "invisible hand, or free market"
    * Say's law: All that is produced will be sold because supply creates its own demand.
+ Austrian Schools
    * believes business cycles are caused by government intervention in the economy.

+ Keynesian School
    * believes these fluctuations are primarily due to swings in the level of optimism of those who run business. `changes in expectation`
    * argues that wages are "downward sticky", reducing the ability of a decrease in money wages to increase SRAS and move the economy from recession back toward full employment.
+ New Keynesian School: added the assertion that the prices of productive inputs other than labor are also "downward sticky" presenting additional barriers to the restoration of full-employment equilibrium.
+ Monetarist's school
    * believes the variations in AD that cause business cycles are due to variations in the rate of growth of the money supply, likely from inappropriate decisions by the monetary authorities.
    * believes that recession can be caused by external shocks or by inappropriate decrease in the money supply.
+ New Classical school introduced real business cycle theory (RBC).
    * RBC emphasizes the effect of real economic variables such as changes in technology and external shocks, as opposed to monetary variables, as the cause of business cycles.
    * RBC applies utility theory

## unemployment
### unemployment
> employed: the number of people with a job
> labor force: the number of people who either have a job or are actively looking for a job
> unemployed: people who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job.
> activity ratio: the ratio of labor force to total population of working age
> underemployed: a person who has a job but has the qualifications to work at a significantly higher-paying job.
> discouraged worker:  a person who has stopped looking for a job. Discouraged workers are statistically outside the labor force, which means they are not counted in the official unemployment rate.

unemployment can be divided into three categories:
    1. frictional unemployment: results from the time lag necessary to match employees who seek work with employers needing their skills.
    2. structural unemployment: is caused by long-run changes in the economy that eliminate some jobs while generating others for which unemployed workers are not qualified.
    3. cyclical unemployment: is caused by changes in the general level of economic activity. Cyclic unemployment is positive when the economy is operating at less than full capacity and can be negative when an expansion leads to employment temporarily over the full employment level

> unemployment rate: is the percentage of people in the labor force who are unemployed

## `x`flation
+ `inflation` is a persistent increase in the price level of almost all good and services over time
+ `hyperinflation` is inflation that accelerates out of control.
+ `disinflation` (通货紧缩) refers to an inflation rate that is decreasing over time but remains greater than zero.
+ `deflation` refers to a persistently decreasing price level. Deflation is commonly associated with **deep recessions**.

### indices used to measure inflation
A price index measures the average price for a defined basket of goods and services.
+ consumer price index (CPI)
    CPI= cost of basket at current prices / cost of basket at base period prices * 100
+ Laspeyres index: a price index created by holding the composition of the consumption basket **constant**.

Using a fixed basket of goods and services has three serious biases:
+ substitution bias: as the price of one good or service rises, people may substitute it with other goods or services that have a lower price.
+ quality bias: as the quality of the same product improves over time, it satisfies people's needs and wants better. One such example is the quality of cars.
+ new product bias: new products are frequently introduced and a fixed basket of goods and services will not include them.

+ Paasche index: an index formula using the **current** composition of a basket
+ Fisher index: is the geometric mean of Laspeyres index and Paasche index

### explaining inflation
+ cost-push inflation
    inflation can result from an initial decrease in AS caused by an increase in the real price of an important factor of production, such as wages or energy.
    $$ULC = WI/O$$
    where
    ULC = unit labor cost
    O = output per hour per worker
    W = total labor compensation per hour per worker
+ demand-pull inflation
    demand-pull inflation can result from an increase in the money supply, increased government spending, or any other change that increase AD
+ headline inflation is a percentage change in a price index for all goods. Core inflation is calculated by excluding food and energy prices from a price index because of their high short-term volatility.

## economic indicators
> economic indicator is a variable that provides information on the state of the overall economy.

+ leading indicators: average weekly hours in manufacturing; initial claims for unemployment insurance; manufactures' new orders for consumer goods; manufactures' new orders for non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft; building permit for new houses; S&P 500 equity price index; leading credit index; 10-year Treasury to Fed funds interest rate spread; and consumer expectations
+ coincident indicators: employees on non-agricultural payrolls (非农); real personal income; index of industrial production; manufacturing and trade sales;
+ lagging indicators: average duration of unemployment (businesses wait until ...); inventory-sales ratio; change in unit labor costs (businesses are slow to fire/hire workers considering the cost ); average prime lending rate; commercial and industrial loans; ratio of consumer installment debt to income; change in consumer price index.

## miscellaneous
+ the characteristic business cycle patterns of trough, expansion, peak, and contraction are recurrent, not periodic.
+ based on typical labor utilization patterns across the business cycle, productivity (output per hours worked) is most likely to be highest at the bottom of a recession because firms will run "lean production" to generate maximum output with the fewest number of workers
+ physical capital adjustments to downturns come through aging of equipment plus lack of maintenance
+ the characteristic of national consumer price indexes which is most typically shared across major economies worldwide is their use in the determination of macroeconomic policy
+ CPI is used as a benchmark for adjusting labor contract payments while PPI is more closely connected to business contracts.
+ For productivity, or output per hour, the faster that it can grow, the further that wages can rise without putting pressure on business costs per unit of output.
