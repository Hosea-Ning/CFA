# Financail reporting and analysis and corporate finance

## Financail ratio list

+ Current ratio = Current assets ÷ Current liabilities

+ Quick ratio = (Cash + Short-term marketable investments + Receivables) ÷ Current liabilities

+ Cash ratio = (Cash + Short-term marketable investments) ÷ Current liabilities

+ Defensive interval ratio = (Cash + Short-term marketable + investments + Receivables) ÷ Daily cash expenditures

+ Receivables turnover ratio = Total revenue ÷ Average receivables

+ Days of sales outstanding (DSO) = Number of days in period ÷ + Receivables turnover ratio

+ Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold ÷ Average inventory

+ Days of inventory on hand (DOH) = Number of days in period ÷ + Inventory turnover ratio

+ Payables turnover ratio = Purchases ÷ Average trade payables

+ Number of days of payables = Number of days in period ÷ Payables + turnover ratio

+ Cash conversion cycle (net operating cycle) = DOH + DSO – Number + of days of payables

+ Working capital turnover ratio = Total revenue ÷ Average working + capital

+ Fixed asset turnover ratio = Total revenue ÷ Average net fixed assets

+ Total asset turnover ratio = Total revenue ÷ Average total assets

+ Gross profit margin = Gross profit ÷ Total revenue

+ Operating profit margin = Operating profit ÷ Total revenue

+ Pretax margin = Earnings before tax but after interest ÷ Total  revenue

+ Net profit margin = Net income ÷ Total revenue

+ Operating return on assets = Operating income ÷ Average total + assets

+ Return on assets = Net income ÷ Average total assets

+ Return on equity = Net income ÷ Average shareholders’ equity

+ Return on total capital = Earnings before interest and taxes ÷  (Interest bearing debt + Shareholders’ equity)

+ Return on common equity = (Net income – Preferred dividends) ÷  Average common shareholders’ equity

+ Tax burden = Net income ÷ Earnings before taxes

+ Interest burden = Earnings before taxes ÷ Earnings before + interest and taxes

+ EBIT margin = Earnings before interest and taxes ÷ Total revenue

+ Financial leverage ratio (equity multiplier) = Average total assets ÷ Average shareholders’ equity

+ Total debt = The total of interest-bearing short-term and long-term debt, excluding liabilities such as accrued expenses + and accounts payable

+ Debt-to-assets ratio = Total debt ÷ Total assets

+ Debt-to-equity ratio = Total debt ÷ Total shareholders’ equity

+ Debt-to-capital ratio = Total debt ÷ (Total debt + Total + shareholders’ equity)

+ Interest coverage ratio = Earnings before interest and taxes ÷  Interest payments

+ Fixed charge coverage ratio = (Earnings before interest and taxes + Lease payments) ÷ (Interest payments + Lease payments)

+ Dividend payout ratio = Common share dividends ÷ Net income + attributable to common shares

+ Retention rate = (Net income attributable to common shares – Common share dividends) ÷ Net income attributable to common + shares = 1 – Payout ratio

+ Sustainable growth rate = Retention rate × Return on equity

+ Earnings per share = (Net income – Preferred dividends) ÷ + Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding

+ Book value per share = Common stockholders’ equity ÷ Total number + of common shares outstanding

+ Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) = Cash flow from operating + activities – Investment in fixed capital + Net borrowing

+ Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) = Cash flow from operating activities + Interest expense × (1 – Tax rate) – Investment in fixed capital (Interest expense should be added back only if it was subtracted in determining cash flow from operating activities. This may not be the case for companies electing an + alternative treatment under IFRS.)

## intercompany investment

|   |Financail assets | Associates | Business combinations | Joint Venture|
|---|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| Degree of influence | No significant | significant | Controlling | Shared control |
| Typical ownership   | < 20%          | 20%~50%     |  > 50% | Varies |
| Current Financail reporting | Held to maturity (**only for bond**); AFS (OCI); Fair value through P/L; Loan & receivables; | Equity method | Consolidation | Equity method or proportionate consolidation |
| New Financail reporting | FV through P/L; FV through OCI; Amortized cost (HTM); | Equity method | Consolidation | Equity method |

+ financial assets (<20%)
  + Available for sale (AFS): unrealized gain and loss in **OCI**, carried at market value
  + Held for trading: gain and loss in **income**, carried at market value
  + Held-to-maturity (HTM): carried at historical cost plus any discout, or minus any premium, reported on the BS at **amortized cost**
+ equity method
+ acquisition method (consolidation)
  + goodwill

    goodwill is lower using the partial goodwill method.
    + full goodwill: debt + full equity (full minority interest)

      full goodwill = (fair value of equity of whole subsidiary) - (fair value of net identifiable net assets of the subsidiary)
    + partial goodwill: debt + partial equity (partial minority interest)

      partial goodwill = purchase price - (% owned * FV of net identifiable assets of the subsidiary)

    testing for impairment:
    + IFRS, if carrying amount of the cash generating unit > the recoverable amount (fair value)
    + US GAAP, 1. if the carrying value (including goodwill) > fair value; 2. loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill (fair total value - fair identifiable value).

  + minority interest

+ SPE and VIE
  if an SPE is considered a VIE, it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary.

  + SPE: a special purpose entity is legal structure created to isolate certain assets and liabilities of the sponsor.
  + VIE (one or both):
    1. at-risk equity that is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional financail support
    2. equity investors that lack any one of the following:
       + decision making rights
       + the obligation to absorb expected losses
       + the right to receive expected residual returns

`operating amrgin` = 毛利率

Key attributes of **the pooling-of-interests method**:

+ The two firms are combined using historical book values
+ operating results for prior periods are restated as though the two firm were always combined
+ ownership interests continue, and former accounting bases are maintained

## Projected benefit obligation (PBO)

Asset at the end of the year = Asset at the beginning of the year + contributions + actual return - beneifts paid

PBO at the end of the year = PBO at the beginning of the year + current service cost + interest cost + past service cost (+/-) actuarial losses / gains  - benefits paid

+ Current service cost: present value of benefits earned by the employees during the current period. Immediately recognized in the income statement.
+ Interest cost. Immediately recognized as a component of pension expense. If the plan is reporting a liability (an underfunded plan), an expense is reported. If the plan reports an asset, interest income is reported.
+ Past (prior) service costs are retroactive benefits awarded to emmployees when a plan is initiated or amended. Under IFRS, expensed immediately in P & L; under US GAAP, amortized over the average service life of employees in OCI.
+ Changes in actuarial assumptions
+ Benefit paid

| Component | US GAAP | IFRS |
| --------- | ------- | ---- |
| Current service cost | Income | Income |
| Past service cost | OCI | Income |
| Interest cost | Income | Income (net) |
| Expected return | Income | - |
| Actuarial gains/losses | Amortized portion in income, unamortized in OCI | All in OCI |

Expected return on plan assets. a component of pension expense. The difference in the expected return and the actual return is combined with other items related to changes in actuarial assumptions into the "actuarial gains and losses" account.

Actuarial gains and losses. recognized in OCI.

total periodic pension cost (TPPC) = employer contributions - (ending funded status - beginning funded status)

funded status = fair value of plan assets - PBO

### periodic pension cost

Under IFRS,

periodic pension cost = Service costs (P&L) + net interest expense (P&L) + remeasurement (OCI) = current service cost + past service cost + discount * beginning funded status + remeasurement

Under US GAAP, use Corridor Approach

if beginning balance of actuarial gains and losses > 10% * max(beginning PBO or plan assets), this 10% is corridor.

periodic pension cost = Current service cost (P&L) + past service cost (OCI) + interest cost (P&L) - expected return on plan assets (P&L) + unamortized excess above corridor (OCI)

| Effect on ... | Increase discount rate | decrease rate of compensation growth | increase expected rate of return |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------|
| Balance Sheet Liability | decrease | decrease | no effect |
| TPPC | decrease | decrease | no effect |
| Periodic pension cost in P&L | decrease* | decrease | decrease** |

increasing the discount rate:

+ PBO lower ↓ -> improves the funded status of the plan ↑
+ lower TPPC because of the lower current service cost
+ reduce interest cost (PBO*r) unless the plan is mature

decreasing the compensation growth rate will:

+ reduce future benefit payments ↓ -> PBO lower
+ reduce current service cost and lower interest cost

increase the expected return on plan asset (US GAAP) will:

+ reduce periodic pernsion cost in P&L
+ no effect on the benefit obligation or the funded status of the plan

## Multinational operations

`local currency` is the currency of the country being referred to.

`functional currency` is the currency of the primary econmoic environment in which the entity operates.

`presentation (reporting) currency` is the currency in which the parent company prepares its financial statements.

there are two method used to remeasure or translate the financial statement of a foreign subsidiary to the parent's presentation (reporting) currency.

+ **Remeasurement** involves converting the local currency into functional currency using the **temporal method**.
+ **Translation** involves converting the functional currency into the parent's presentation currency using the **current rate method**.

Local currency = Functional currency <Current rate> presentation currency
Local currency <Temporal> Functional currency = presentation currency
Local currency <Temporal> Functional currency <Current rate> presentation currency

`current rate` is the exchange rate on the balance sheet date

`average rate` is the average exchange rate over the reporting period

`historical rate` is the actual rate that was in effect when the original transaction occurred.

### Applying the current rate method

+ all income statement accounts are translated at the average rate.
+ All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate except for common stock, which is translated at the historical rate that applied when the stock was issued.
+ Divivdends are translated at the rate that applied when they were declared
+ translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders' equity as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA).

### Applying the temporal method

+ monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using the current exchange rate (end-of-period). Monetary assets and liabilities are fixed in the amount of currency to be recerived or paid and include: cash, receivables, payables, and short-term and long-term debt.
+ All other assets and liablilities are considered nonmonetary and are remeasured at the historical rate. The most common nonmonetary assets include inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets. An example of a nonmonetary liability is unearned revenue.
+ Just like the current rate method, common stock and dividends paid are remeasured at the historical rate.
+ Expenses related to nonmonetary assets such as COGS, depreciation expense, and amortization expense are remeasured based on the historical rates prevailing at the time of purchase.
+ Revenues and all other expenses are translated at the average rate.
+ Remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. This results in more volatile net income as compared to the current rate method whereby the translation gain or loass is reported in shareholders' equity.

| Items | Temporal Method | Current Rate Method |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Monetary assets and liabilities | Current rate | Current rate |
| Nonmonetary assets and liabilities | Historical rate | Current rate |
| Common stock | Historical rate | Historical rate |
| Equity | Mixed | Current rate |
| Revenues and SG&A | average rate | average rate |
| COGS | Historical rate | average rate |
| Depre & Amort | Historical rate | average rate |
| Net income | Mixed rate | average rate |
| Exposure | Net monetary assets | Net rate |
| Exchange rate gain or loss | Income statement | Equity |

Temporal method exposure = monetoray asset - monetoray liabilities
Current rate method exposure = total asset - total liabilities
